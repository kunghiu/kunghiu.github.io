My name is Kung Hiu. I am a biostatistician, son, and bicycler.

I study as a doctor student in SYSU. Now I have interests in statistic softwares like R, Python, and so on. I will record some of my study/research here as archive.

If you have interest in my topics, I will be very happy to receive your feedback. You can find me by email: x.gong@foxmail.com.
